### Step 1: Starting Points and Suggesting Options
1. **Allocate Points**: Each participant starts with 100 points.
2. **Suggest Initial Option**: Everyone gets to suggest one option for free.
3. **Additional Suggestions**: If any participant wants to suggest more than one option, each additional suggestion costs 25 points from their starting pool.

### Step 2: Distribution of Points
1. **List All Options**: Compile and display all the suggested options clearly for all participants.
2. **Distribute Points**:
   - Participants can distribute their points across any of the options.
   - No participant can allocate more than 50% of their points to their own suggestion(s).
   - Points can be divided in any integer amount among the available options.

### Step 3: Voting Process
1. **Submit Votes**: Each participant submits their final distribution of points secretly to avoid influencing others.
2. **Calculate Totals**: Collect all the points assigned to each option and calculate the total points each option received.

### Step 4: Determine the Winner
1. **Identify Highest Points**: The option with the highest total number of points wins.
2. **Handle Ties**:
   - If there's a tie for the highest points, a runoff vote is conducted.
   - In the runoff, each participant gets 100 points again, but can only vote among the tied options.
